Thank you to all the HiPerGator support staff, especially Charles Taylor, for enabling me to keep this research moving forward in spite of the infrastructural problems I bumped into along the way.


Thank you to all the yt community, especially Nathan Goldbaum, for providing a tool that helps me juggle all the crazy unit systems and patiently answering my questions about the codebase.

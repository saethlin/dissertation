%%% Below are the commands to set the degree type, department, graduation time, and chair. 
%       Most of these are self explanatory. 
%       Note: The \chair command takes an optional argument for a cochair. 
%           So if John was your chair and Jacob was a cochair, you would use \chair[Jacob]{John}.
%           If John was your chair and you had no cochair, you can simply use \chair{John}.

%%% For each of the following, type in the name of the file that contains each section. 
%       They are assumed to be tex files, but if they aren't the command takes an optional argument for the extension.
%       So, you could load dedication.tex as your dedication file using \setDedicationFile{dedication}
%       You could load dedication.txt instead with \setDedicationFile[txt]{dedication}.
%       NOTE: For some compilers they may or may not add a .tex to the end of the file automatically.
%           If you get a "couldn't find dedication.tex.tex" type error, try the command with an empty optional argument,
%           e.g. \setDedicationFile[]{dedication}
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% These are REQUIRED sections; easiest to do via these commands.

\setDedicationFile{dedicationFile}%                 Dedication Page
\setAcknowledgementsFile{acknowledgementsFile}%     Acknowledgements Page
\setAbstractFile{abstractFile}%                     Abstract Page (This should only include the abstract itself)
\setReferenceFile{biblio}{mnras}%         References. First argument is your bibtex source file
%                                                       the second argument is your bibtex style file.
\setBiographicalFile{biographyFile}%                Biography file of the Author (you).

%%% These are NOT required, so only use them if you actually need/have them.

%\setAbbreviationsFile{abbreviations}%         Abbreviations Page
\setAppendixFile{appendix}%                    Appendix Content; hyperlinking might be weird.
%\multipleAppendixtrue%                         Uncomment this if you have more than one appendix,
%                                                   comment it if you have only one appendix.

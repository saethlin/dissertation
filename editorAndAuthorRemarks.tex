\section{Example of using the authorRemark and editorRemark}
If you don't see any blue or red type under this line, then you almost certainly need to include the optional ``editMode" to the document class. Thus your document class (first line) should read \verb|\documentclass[editMode]{ufdissertation}|.

\authorRemark{Test! This is a remark written by the author, to themselves, for review purposes. It will be suppressed unless editMode is used in the class options.}

\editorRemark{This is an editor's remark, written by an editor in-line so that they can write into the content itself with something easy to see. But the remark will be suppressed unless editMode is used in the class options.

To get this remark to go away, simply remove ``editMode" from the documentclass options at the top of the user's tex-file. This also removes the blue Author Remarks.

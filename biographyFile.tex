Benjamin Kimock joined The University of Florida in 2015 to study exoplanet astronomy.
After 2 years, he realized that the problems he spent time on were compelling because they involved compute-heavy tasks.
So he took a risk and joined a very new research group under Desika Narayanan to work on the project that is presented here.
In the 3 years of his work on LABs, Ben found a deep appreciation for helping teammates and mentoring younger students and hopes to carry those forward into an industry career.
